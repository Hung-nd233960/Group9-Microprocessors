## SSD1306 
- The SSD1306 is the integrated controller chip that powers many small OLED displays including the module we are going to use(0.96-inch 128x64 module). This controller handles the communication between the ESP32 and the OLED panel, enabling the display to show text, graphics, and more.

![alt text](images-Sensors-Controller/image-39.png)

- OLED, short for Organic Light-Emitting Diode, is a popular display module. These displays come in various sizes and can support different colors. They communicate using either the I¬≤C or SPI protocol.

### How OLED module works?
We won't dive into the details of how OLED technology works; instead, we'll focus on what's relevant for our exercises. The module has a resolution of 128x64, giving it a total of 128 √ó 64 = 8192 pixels. Each pixel can be turned on or off independently.

In the datasheet, the 128 columns are referred to as segments, while the 64 rows are called commons (be careful not to confuse "commons" with "columns" due to their similar spelling).

#### Memory
The OLED display's pixels are arranged in a page structure within GDDRAM (Graphics Display DRAM). GDDRAM is divided into 8 pages (From Page 0 to Page 7), each consisting of 128 columns (segments) and 8 rows(commons).

![alt text](images-Sensors-Controller/image-40.png)

A segment is 8 bits of data (one byte), with each bit representing a single pixel. When writing data, you will write an entire segment, meaning the entire byte is written at once.

![alt text](images-Sensors-Controller/image-41.png)
We can re-map both segments and commons through software for mechanical flexibility.

#### Pages and Segments
I created an image to show how 128x64 pixels are divided into 8 pages. I then focused on a single page, which contains 128 segments (columns) and 8 rows. Finally, I zoomed in on a single segment to demonstrate how it represents 8 vertically stacked pixels, with each pixel corresponding to one bit.
![alt text](images-Sensors-Controller/image-42.png)

#### Circuit 
We will use I2C for communication between the ESP32 and the OLED display. For I2C, two GPIO pins need to be configured as SDA (Serial Data) and SCL (Serial Clock). On the ESP32, we can use any GPIO pins for I2C. We'll configure GPIO pin 9 as SCL and GPIO pin 8 as SDA. The VCC pin of the OLED will be connected to the 3.3V pin of the ESP32, and the Ground pin will be connected to the ESP32's ground.

| **ESP32 Pin** | **OLED Pin** | **Notes**                                                                 |
|---------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3.3V          | VCC          | Supplies power to the OLED display.                                      |
| GND           | Ground       | Connects to the ground pin of the OLED.                                  |
| GPIO 9       | SCL          | Connects the clock signal (SCL) for I2C communication.                   |
| GPIO 8       | SDA          | Connects the data signal (SDA) for I2C communication.                    |


#### Dependency used in Rust coding
- ssd1306 = "0.10.0"
- embedded-graphics = "0.8.1"
- display-interface = "0.5.0"      (SSD1306 OLED display driver)

This crate offers a driver interface for the SSD1306 monochrome OLED display, supporting both I2C and SPI through the display_interface crate. It also has async support that you have to enable through the feature flag.

For more details read in here :

https://crates.io/crates/ssd1306 

https://crates.io/crates/embedded-graphics

https://crates.io/crates/display-interface

Add ssd1306 with Async support : 

```
# ssd1306 = { version = "0.9.0", features = ["async"] }
# https://github.com/rust-embedded-community/ssd1306/issues/219
ssd1306 = { git = "https://github.com/rust-embedded-community/ssd1306.git", rev = "f3a2f7aca421fbf3ddda45ecef0dfd1f0f12330e", features = [
    "async",
] }
```

- Embedded Graphics : 

To display text or draw images on the OLED display, we will use the embedded_graphics crate in combination with the ssd1306 crate.

"Embedded-graphics is a 2D graphics library that is focused on memory constrained embedded devices."

"A core goal of embedded-graphics is to draw graphics without using any buffers; the crate is no_std compatible and works without a dynamic memory allocator, and without pre-allocating large chunks of memory. To achieve this, it takes an Iterator based approach, where pixel colors and positions are calculated on the fly, with the minimum of saved state. This allows the consuming application to use far less RAM at little to no performance penalty."

You can use this crate with various OLED displays and drivers when working with different types of OLED modules. The documentation provides a detailed explanation of the features and supported drivers. I recommend going through it.

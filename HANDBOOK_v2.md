# Engineering Handbook

## Overall Information

This handbook serves as a comprehensive guide for the engineering principles, methodologies, and technical details involved in this project. It is structured to facilitate understanding for both new and experienced engineers, providing insights into the development, implementation, and operation of the system.

The handbook is designed to be read sequentially, but each chapter can also be referenced independently as needed.

## How To Read This Handbook

This handbook is written in Markdown format, which is a lightweight markup language that makes it easy to structure and style text. For an optimal reading experience, it is recommended to use a dedicated Markdown reader such as Obsidian or Visual Studio Code with a Markdown plugin.

## Week 3: Rust Basics 1
#### Date: Mar 17, 2025

#### Task: Learn the basics of Rust. Part 1: The Basics

#### a. Rust the Programming Language

Rust is a general-purpose programming language emphasizing performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety, meaning that all references point to valid memory.

In Basics 1, we will learn about basics of Rust: Cargo, Variables, Data Types, Functions, Control Flow.

The task for the week is to:

- Understand the basics of Rust
- Write a small code that is "guessing game", guessing a number from 1 to 10 in command line
- Compare C, Rust and Python by adding 1 million times.

Please document everything you done, even the Rust language.

#### b. Conclusion:

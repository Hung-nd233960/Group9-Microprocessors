# OxyRem Project Plan

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This document outlines the overall work required to develop **OxyRem**, a wearable SpOâ‚‚ and heart rate monitor built using **Rust for embedded systems**. The project is structured into multiple phases, including learning, hardware development, software implementation, testing, and reporting.

## ðŸš€ Key Objectives

- **Learn Rust & Rust Embedded** â€“ Mastering Rust and its embedded capabilities.
- **Understand Communication Protocols** â€“ SPI, I2C, UART for sensor and OLED interaction.
- **Develop a Logging, Alert, and Warning System** â€“ Efficient data storage, processing, and notifications.
- **Design the Wearable Frame & Electronics** â€“ Soldering, integrating hardware, and mechanical design.
- **Prepare Reports & Final Presentation** â€“ Document findings and present the project effectively.
